This mod add compatibility between AE2 and Create. This mod requires [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and [AE2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2).

Adds an AE Stock Bridge that links the two storage systems together. Items in the Create Stock system show up as craftable items in AE. Create can request stored items from AE through the bridge with a packager connected.

Future plans:
- Refined Storage support
- AE/RS autocrafting from Create
